It's nice to meet you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                +

 Student: So she has sent me in just to ask you some questions and do a brief physical exam and then I will step back out and talk to her and then she'll be in behind me. Is that okay?                                                                                                                                                                                                         +

 Student: Oh, goodness. Well, I'm glad you came in so we can take a look and make sure there's nothing going on.

Must have been scary.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            +

 Patient: I was at a stoplight and the person behind me rear-ended me. We weren't going very fast though. I think he was maybe going 5 or 10 miles an hour.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      +

 Patient: Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  +
 Student: And so you said you didn't go to the hospital or anything because you didn't feel any pain initially?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  +
 Patient: No.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    +
 Student: So when exactly did the pain start? About how many hours after the accident?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           +
 Patient: I would probably say maybe 4 to 6 hours after. I think maybe I was just in shock at first and so I didn't really feel any pain or anything.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            +
 Student: Alright. And where is it bothering you specifically? Can you pinpoint a specific area on your neck?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    +
 Patient: It's mostly just the back of my neck and on the sides of my neck.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      +

 Student: Alright. And did you hear any pops or have any numbness or tingling that occurred during the accident?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 +

 Student: Alright. And is there anything that's making the pain worse?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           +
 Patient: Mostly when I bend my head forward and try to turn it to the left, it kind of is really tight.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         +
 Student: Anything you've noticed that's helping it?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             +
 Patient: I took some ibuprofen and I put ice on the back of my neck and that helped a little bit but it still hurts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            +
 Student: It still hurts? And how much ibuprofen are you taking?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 +

 Student: I'm just taking some notes so that way when I go talk to Dr. Parrott I can be thorough and let her know everything you're telling me. So it's worse whenever you're bending forward and to the side to the left. Correct?                                                                                                                                                              +

And can you describe the pain to me?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          +
 Patient: It just feels like a tight kind of dull pain.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          +
 Student: So tight and dull. And is this pain radiating or moving anywhere?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      +
 Patient: Not really, it just goes up and down the back of my neck.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              +

 Student: And on a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being the worst pain, where would you say you're at?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                +
 Patient: Probably around a 6 or a 7 out of 10. Especially when I try and bend forward and turn my head.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         +
 Student: And is it a constant pain?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             +
 Patient: Yes. But it'll get worse whenever you bend forward and turn to the left.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               +
 Student: Okay. And would you say since the accident, since that evening, has it been constant or is it getting worse, better? What would you say?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               +
 Patient: It feels like it's getting worse, but I don't know if that's because the ibuprofen's not working.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      +
 Student: Well I'm glad you came in. You know, the over-the-counter stuff's not working and we can do an exam and make sure there's nothing we're missing and, you know, if we need to possibly do some osteopathic treatments and we'll get onto that later, okay?                                                                                                                              +

 Patient: Occasional. I'll have a glass of wine with dinner maybe once a week.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   +
 Student: Alright. Well, I believe I got all the information I needed from you, so we're going to go ahead and move on to the physical exam portion. So what I'm going to do is I'm just going to have you take a seat up here.                                                                                                                                                                  +

 Student: For the physical exam I'm going to go ahead and listen to your heart and lungs and make sure those sound nice and clear. So I'm just going to slide this down and just breathe normal. Good. I'm going to take a big deep breath and again and again and last one. Good.                                                                                                               +
 Student: And so I'm just going to do a structural exam here and palpate down your spine. Let me know if there's anything that's tender.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         +

 Student: Everywhere. Okay. Work my way down. And I'm going to check the range of motion in your neck. So what I want you to do is try to put your chin down to your chest.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      +

 Student: And then looking up to the ceiling.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    +

 Student: Okay. And what about looking, turning and looking over to this shoulder.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               +

 Student: Alright, and turn and look to that shoulder for me.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    +

 Student: And then ear to your shoulder. Try to touch your ear over to your shoulder.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            +
 Patient: And then ear to the shoulder. That's as far as I can go.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               +
 Student: Alright. And I'm going to go ahead and check just some reflexes. This will kind of tell me if there's any nerves that are involved. So just relax your arm. And we're going to rest your arm right here on your lap. And just relax. Good. And I'm going to do the same thing on this arm. Just relax your arm. Just relax. And then last one, just let your arm hang.                 +
 Student: And now I'm going to test and see how strong you are. So place your arms like this for me and don't let me move your arms.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             +

 Student: And arms up. And don't let me push them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               +

 Student: And fingers out for me. Don't let me squeeze them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     +
 Patient: And fingers together and try to push them out.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         +
 Student: Good. Alright. If it's okay with you, as an osteopathic student, we've learned some treatments. So I'm going to do some soft tissue to try and break up some of this tension that you're having. If that sounds okay. I don't want to hurt you too bad.                                                                                                                                +
 Patient: No, it's not going to hurt.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            +
 Student: And if there's any pain, I want you to let me know. And so I'm just going to do just very gentle. It's called myofascial. I'm just going to slowly up. Good. And if this is something that you do get some relief from after this evening, then you can come back and we can be a little more aggressive. But since the car accident was just two days ago, I want to be very gentle.  +
 Patient: Okay.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  +
 Student: I'm just going to hold this right here. All those muscles that are tight and spasming right now attach right up where my fingers are at. So I'm just trying to get them to relax and loosen.                                                                                                                                                                                           +
 Patient: So this is supposed to relax all the muscles of your neck?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             +
 Student: Uh-huh. Yep.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           +
 Patient: Okay.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  +
 Student: Alright. I think that'll be enough for today. I don't want to do too much, since it was such an acute injury. I'm going to go ahead and help you up. And then I'm going to go ahead and summarize everything that you told me from earlier, if that's okay. Would you prefer sitting back down in the chair?                                                                           +
 Patient: Sure.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  +
 Student: Okay. So you started having some neck pain two days ago after a motor vehicle accident. You were rear-ended, but you were wearing your seat belt. You didn't hear any pop or have any numbness or tingling that occurred, and it's just been real tight for the past two days. Real constant, but it's worse whenever you flex your head down or turn to the left. Is that correct?    +
 Patient: Yes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   +
 Student: And as far as your past medical history, you just have asthma, and you're taking some medication for that. Okay. And you're not allergic to anything?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  +
 Patient: Penicillin.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            +
 Student: Excuse me. Yes, that's right. You are allergic to penicillin. Alright. What I will do is I will go talk to Dr. Parrott, and then we will be back in to put together a treatment option plan for you. Any other questions or concerns you have for me today?                                                                                                                            +
 Patient: No, I don't think so. Just want to feel better.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        +
 Student: Alright. Well, that is our main goal, so I'm glad you came in today.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   +
 Patient: Great.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 +
 Student: Thank you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             +
