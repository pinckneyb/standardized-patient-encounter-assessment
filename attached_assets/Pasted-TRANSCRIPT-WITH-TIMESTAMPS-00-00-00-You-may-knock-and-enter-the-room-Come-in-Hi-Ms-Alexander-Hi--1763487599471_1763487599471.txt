TRANSCRIPT WITH TIMESTAMPS:

[00:00:00] You may knock and enter the room Come in Hi Ms Alexander Hi Hi my
[00:00:08] name is Brittany and I'm a medical student working with Dr Parrott today Try to
[00:00:14] get this all rubbed in It's nice to meet you Nice to meet you So
[00:00:19] she has sent me in just to ask you some questions and do a brief
[00:00:21] physical exam and then I will step back out and talk to her and then
[00:00:26] she'll be in behind me Is that okay Yeah that's fine Great So what brings
[00:00:30] you in today I've been having pretty bad neck pain Oh goodness Well I'm glad
[00:00:35] you came in so we can take a look and make sure there's nothing going
[00:00:38] on So how long has this been going on Probably about two days Okay Did
[00:00:43] anything happen a couple days ago out of the ordinary Well I was in a
[00:00:48] small car accident Okay Must have been scary Yeah What happened I was at a
[00:00:57] stoplight and the person behind me rear ended me We weren't going very fast though
[00:01:03] I think he was maybe going five or ten miles an hour And were you
[00:01:09] wearing your seatbelt at the time Yeah Okay And so you said you didn't go
[00:01:14] to the hospital or anything because you didn't feel any pain initially No So when
[00:01:19] exactly did the pain start About how many hours after the accident I would probably
[00:01:25] say maybe four to six hours after I think maybe I was just in shock
[00:01:30] at first and so I didn't really feel any pain or anything Alright And where
[00:01:35] is it bothering you specifically Can you pinpoint a specific area on your neck It's
[00:01:40] mostly just the back of my neck and on the sides of my neck Both
[00:01:44] sides Yes Alright And did you hear any pops or have any numbness or tingling
[00:01:53] that occurred during the accident No Alright And is there anything that's making the pain
[00:02:00] worse Mostly when I bend my head forward and try to turn it to the
[00:02:06] left it kind of gets really tight It's a little uncomfortable Yeah Anything you've noticed
[00:02:11] that's helping it I took some ibuprofen and I put ice on the back of
[00:02:18] my neck and that helped a little bit but it still hurts It still hurts
[00:02:23] Mm hmm And how much ibuprofen are you taking I took two tablets every six
[00:02:29] hours or so since then Okay I'm just taking some notes so that way when
[00:02:36] I go talk to Dr Parrott I can be thorough and let her know everything
[00:02:39] you're telling me Okay So it's worse whenever you're bending forward and to the side
[00:02:46] to the left Is that correct Yes Alright And can you describe the pain to
[00:02:55] me It just feels like a tight kind of dull pain Okay So tight and
[00:03:07] dull And is this pain radiating or moving anywhere Not really It just goes up
[00:03:16] and down the back of my neck So nothing coming down into the arms No
[00:03:21] Okay And on a scale of one to ten with ten being the worst pain
[00:03:27] where would you say you're at Probably around a six or a seven out of
[00:03:33] ten especially when I try and bend forward and turn my head And is it
[00:03:38] a constant pain Yes And so but it'll get worse whenever you bend forward and
[00:03:45] turn to the left Yes Okay And would you say since the accident since that
[00:03:51] evening has it been constant or is it getting worse better What would you say
[00:03:56] It feels like it's getting worse but I don't know if that's because the ibuprofen's
[00:04:01] not working Okay Well I'm glad you came in so you know the over the
[00:04:06] counter stuff's not working and we can do an exam and make sure there's nothing
[00:04:11] we're missing and you know if we need to possibly do some osteopathic treatments and
[00:04:18] we'll get on to that later okay Okay And as far as your past medical
[00:04:25] history have you ever had a neck injury before No No so you've never had
[00:04:31] problems with your neck No Okay that's good to know And any medical conditions that
[00:04:37] you're currently being treated for or that you've ever been treated for I have asthma
[00:04:43] and I take medicine for that so that's about it Okay Ever been hospitalized No
[00:04:52] Ever had any surgeries I had my tonsils taken out when I was a kid
[00:04:58] I think I was probably nine Okay And as far as medications you said you
[00:05:05] take the over the counter ibuprofen and then you take something for asthma What do
[00:05:09] you take for your asthma I take albuterol Do you just take that as needed
[00:05:15] And do you take any other medications I take a loratadine or a claritin for
[00:05:24] allergies Okay What about any herbal supplements vitamins I take a multivitamin And I always
[00:05:38] like to ask all my patients any recreational drug use No And are you allergic
[00:05:46] to any medications I am I'm allergic to penicillin And what happens when you take
[00:05:54] penicillin I break out in a rash We'll be sure never to give you penicillin
[00:05:59] for anything Thank you And as far as family history any medical conditions in the
[00:06:06] family with your mom and dad My mom she's pretty healthy She has diabetes though
[00:06:13] Okay And it's pretty under control Good My dad has high cholesterol but he takes
[00:06:20] medicine for that Any brothers or sisters I have a brother and he's healthy He's
[00:06:27] healthy He doesn't have any conditions or anything And no one's ever had problems with
[00:06:35] joints or arthritis No No No Great And I always like to just get an
[00:06:44] overview of my patients Kind of get to know them a little better What do
[00:06:47] you do for a living I'm an administrative assistant Oh where do you work I
[00:06:51] work for the Fish and Wildlife Services Oh wow That must be fun Yeah You've
[00:06:56] been doing it for a while Yeah for a few years Stressful or pretty It's
[00:07:02] not very stressful at all That's good And are you married I am Congratulations Thanks
[00:07:09] Do you have any children No not yet No children No Alright And so do
[00:07:17] you have hobbies that you like to do I do I like to cook and
[00:07:21] I like to garden It's been kind of difficult to garden because I can't lean
[00:07:27] forward as much for the past two days It can be frustrating when you can't
[00:07:33] do the things you enjoy Yeah Any tobacco use I smoke Probably maybe half a
[00:07:41] pack a day if that And how long have you been smoking Oh I want
[00:07:46] to say maybe seven years or so Okay Any alcohol use Occasional I'll have a
[00:07:54] glass of wine with dinner maybe once a week Okay Alright Well I believe I
[00:08:02] got all the information I needed from you so we're going to go ahead and
[00:08:06] move on to the physical exam portion Okay So what I'm going to do is
[00:08:09] I'm just going to have you take a seat up here Okay Alright For the
[00:08:20] physical exam I'm going to go ahead and listen to your heart and lungs and
[00:08:23] make sure those sound nice and clear Okay So I'm just going to slide this
[00:08:27] down and just breathe normal Okay And go ahead and take a big deep breath
[00:08:40] And again Again And last one Good Okay And so I'm just going to do
[00:08:55] a structural exam here and palpate down your spine Let me know if there's anything
[00:08:59] that's tender It's tender everywhere Everywhere Okay And I'm going to work my way down
[00:09:11] Okay And I'm going to check the range of motion in your neck So what
[00:09:14] I want you to do is try to put your chin down to your chest
[00:09:19] Alright It's about as far as I can go And then looking up to the
[00:09:23] ceiling Pretty stiff Okay And what about looking turning and looking over to the shoulder
[00:09:34] Okay Alright And turn and look to that shoulder for me Right there And then
[00:09:41] ear to your shoulder Try to touch your ear over to your shoulder Chin And
[00:09:47] then ear to the other shoulder That's as far as I can go Alright And
[00:09:53] I'm going to go ahead and check just some reflexes This will kind of tell
[00:09:57] me if there's any nerves that are involved So just relax your arm And we're
[00:10:02] going to rest your arm right here on your lap And just relax Good And
[00:10:11] I'm going to do the same thing on this arm Just relax your arm And
[00:10:18] just relax And then last one just let your arm hang And now I'm going
[00:10:25] to test and see how strong you are So place your arms like this for
[00:10:28] me and don't let me move your arms Good And arms up And don't let
[00:10:36] me push them Good And fingers out for me Don't let me squeeze them And
[00:10:42] fingers together and try to push them out Good Alright If it's okay with you
[00:10:47] as an osteopathic student we've learned some treatments so I'm going to do some soft
[00:10:50] tissue to try and break up some of this tension that you're having If that
[00:10:55] sounds okay Okay I'm going to hurt us out No it's not going to hurt
[00:10:59] And if there's any pain I want you to let me know And so I'm
[00:11:05] just going to do just very gentle it's called myofascial I'm just going to slowly
[00:11:14] up And if this is something that you do get some relief from after this
[00:11:26] evening then you can come back and we can be a little more aggressive but
[00:11:30] since the car accident was just two days ago I want to be very gentle
[00:11:34] Okay Okay I'm just going to hold this right here All those muscles that are
[00:11:44] tight and spasming right now attach right up where my fingers are at so I'm
[00:11:48] just trying to get them to relax and loosen So this is supposed to relax
[00:11:59] all the muscles in my neck Yep All right I think that'll be enough for
[00:12:08] today I don't want to do too much since it was such an acute injury
[00:12:11] So I'm going to go ahead and help you up And then I'm going to
[00:12:20] go ahead and summarize everything that you told me from earlier if that's okay Would
[00:12:25] you prefer sitting back down in the chair Sure Okay So you started having some
[00:12:33] neck pain two days ago after a motor vehicle accident You were rear ended but
[00:12:39] you were wearing your seat belt You didn't hear any pop or have any numbness
[00:12:43] or tingling that occurred and it's just been real tight for the past two days
[00:12:50] real constant but it's worse whenever you flex your head down or turn to the
[00:12:55] left Is that correct Yes And as far as your past medical history you just
[00:13:00] have asthma and you're taking some medication for that Okay And you're not allergic to
[00:13:06] anything Penicillin Yes that's right You are allergic to penicillin All right What I will
[00:13:12] do is I will go talk to Dr Parrott and then we will be back
[00:13:15] in to put together a treatment option planned for you Any other questions or concerns
[00:13:21] you have for me today No I don't think so I just want to feel
[00:13:25] better All right Well that is our main goal so I'm glad you came in
[00:13:29] today Thank you
