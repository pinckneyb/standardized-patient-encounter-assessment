Student (Kelsey): Hello there, Ms. Jones.
Patient (Ms. Jones): Hi there.
Student (Kelsey): My name is Kelsey. I'm a medical student working with your physician. Is it okay if I ask you a few questions and do a brief physical exam?
Patient (Ms. Jones): Absolutely.
Patient (Ms. Jones): Nice to meet you.
Student (Kelsey): Nice to meet you.
Student (Kelsey): Alright, so what brings you in today?
Patient (Ms. Jones): I've just been having some headaches.
Student (Kelsey): Some headaches?
Student (Kelsey): Okay. When did these start for you?
Patient (Ms. Jones): About two to three weeks ago.
Student (Kelsey): Two to three weeks ago.
Student (Kelsey): Okay. And how often are they occurring?
Patient (Ms. Jones): I would say at least three times a week.
Student (Kelsey): Three times a week.
Student (Kelsey): Okay. And are they pretty constant throughout the day or seem to be worse at a particular point?
Patient (Ms. Jones): I think I'm noticing them more in the evenings.
Student (Kelsey): Evenings.
Student (Kelsey): Was there anything that began two weeks ago that you think these might be associated with?
Patient (Ms. Jones): No, not that I know of.
Student (Kelsey): Okay. Can you kind of describe how the headaches feel?
Patient (Ms. Jones): Yeah, I think they're like a dull throb.
Student (Kelsey): Okay. And are they located on any particular part of your head?
Patient (Ms. Jones): Kind of just like right here.
Student (Kelsey): So just kind of around the front of your head and maybe on the temples?
Patient (Ms. Jones): Yeah.
Student (Kelsey): And if you had to put it on a scale from one to ten, or zero to ten, zero being no pain, ten being the worst pain you can imagine, where would this fall?
Patient (Ms. Jones): I think about five.
Student (Kelsey): Five.
Student (Kelsey): Okay. So that sounds like it's interfering with your life quite a bit.
Patient (Ms. Jones): Yeah, it is.
Student (Kelsey): Does anything seem to make it worse?
Patient (Ms. Jones): I think I've noticed that, so I'm a graduate student, and if I'm setting up a lab for students or working on my thesis, anything that kind of stresses me out, I think that that seems to make it worse.
Student (Kelsey): Okay. So stress seems to be the main factor.
Patient (Ms. Jones): Yeah.
Student (Kelsey): Does anything seem to make it better?
Patient (Ms. Jones): If I take an excedrin migraine, it gets better.
Student (Kelsey): Excedrin.
Student (Kelsey): Okay. And then have you noticed any other kinds of symptoms with this, really?
Patient (Ms. Jones): No.
Student (Kelsey): Have you been having any nausea or vomiting?
Patient (Ms. Jones): No.
Student (Kelsey): Any sort of flashes of light or floaters?
Patient (Ms. Jones): No.
Student (Kelsey): Okay. And you said they occur more so in the evening. You don't wake up with a headache.
Patient (Ms. Jones): No.
Student (Kelsey): Okay. Do you feel like they're getting progressively worse?
Patient (Ms. Jones): I do think in the last week or so they've gotten worse.
Student (Kelsey): Okay. Have you noticed any sort of numbness or tingling in your hands or feet?
Patient (Ms. Jones): No.
Student (Kelsey): Any weakness?
Patient (Ms. Jones): No.
Student (Kelsey): Any fevers or chills?
Patient (Ms. Jones): No.
Student (Kelsey): And then I'm also going to ask you a few questions just kind of about your general health.
Patient (Ms. Jones): Okay.
Student (Kelsey): Can you tell me about your diet?
Patient (Ms. Jones): Yeah. I eat pretty healthy.
Student (Kelsey): Okay. Lots of fruits and vegetables, lean protein.
Student (Kelsey): Good. Very good. Not allergic to any foods?
Patient (Ms. Jones): Nope.
Student (Kelsey): Okay. Do you exercise at all?
Patient (Ms. Jones): Yeah. I do hot yoga about three times a week.
Student (Kelsey): Okay. And then any recreational drugs?
Patient (Ms. Jones): No.
Student (Kelsey): Any tobacco use?
Patient (Ms. Jones): No.
Student (Kelsey): Any alcohol?
Patient (Ms. Jones): No.
Student (Kelsey): Okay. Do you drink any caffeine?
Patient (Ms. Jones): I drink a cup of coffee every day.
Student (Kelsey): Okay. And have you changed your routine with that at all?
Patient (Ms. Jones): Nope. No.
Student (Kelsey): Haven't been skipping any mornings? Okay. Just want to make sure that's not a caffeine headache. That would be a simple fix.
Student (Kelsey): And you said you're a graduate student right now?
Patient (Ms. Jones): Mm-hmm.
Student (Kelsey): No part-time job?
Patient (Ms. Jones): No.
Student (Kelsey): Okay. And then what's your relationship status?
Patient (Ms. Jones): I am married.
Student (Kelsey): Married?
Student (Kelsey): Okay. For how long?
Patient (Ms. Jones): Three years.
Student (Kelsey): All right. And then do you have any medical issues that you're currently being treated for?
Patient (Ms. Jones): I have an inhaler. I have asthma. I haven't used it in probably six months, though.
Student (Kelsey): Okay. Any medical conditions in your past?
Patient (Ms. Jones): No.
Student (Kelsey): No? Okay. Healthy growing up?
Patient (Ms. Jones): Yep.
Student (Kelsey): Very good. Any drug allergies that you know of?
Patient (Ms. Jones): Sulfa.
Student (Kelsey): Sulfa.
Student (Kelsey): Okay. Any past surgeries?
Patient (Ms. Jones): None.
Student (Kelsey): No? Any hospitalizations?
Patient (Ms. Jones): No.
Student (Kelsey): Okay. And then can you tell me about your family's health? How's your mom and how's your dad?
Patient (Ms. Jones): Yeah. Both of my parents are pretty healthy. My dad has high blood pressure. My mom doesn't take medicine for anything.
Student (Kelsey): Okay. Any history of any cancers in the family?
Patient (Ms. Jones): Not that I know. Well, wait. My grandpa had lung cancer, but he smoked.
Student (Kelsey): And then are you taking any other medications besides the Excedrin?
Patient (Ms. Jones): No.
Student (Kelsey): Okay. All right. Well, I think I've got a pretty good history here. I'm going to transition over to the physical exam.
Patient (Ms. Jones): Okay.
Student (Kelsey): Okay. I'm just going to listen to your heart first.
Patient (Ms. Jones): Okay.
Student (Kelsey): Okay. I'm going to bring your head down a little bit. Well, or maybe not. Okay. I'm going to listen to your lungs.
Student (Kelsey): Big breath in and out through an open mouth.
Student (Kelsey): One more. Last one.
Patient (Ms. Jones): Okay.
Student (Kelsey): Let's see. All right. I'm just going to take a look in your eyes.
Student (Kelsey): Very good. Can you open your mouth?
Patient (Ms. Jones): Uh-huh.
Student (Kelsey): Any sort of pain when I push here?
Patient (Ms. Jones): No.
Student (Kelsey): Not really? Okay. All right. I want you to follow my finger. So move just your eyes, not your head.
Patient (Ms. Jones): Okay.
Student (Kelsey): Okay. Good. Now I'm just going to touch your face. Does this feel equal on both sides?
Patient (Ms. Jones): Uh-huh.
Student (Kelsey): Okay. All right. Now I'm going to have you make some funny faces for me. I want you to lift your eyebrows up real high. Now squeeze your eyes shut. Don't let me pull them open. Good. Puff out your cheeks. I'm going to press them. Okay. Good. Now stick out your tongue. All right. Good. Now try to push my hand away. Good. And the other side. Good. Shrug your shoulders. Very good.
Student (Kelsey): All right. Now I'm just going to check some reflexes. Okay. And let your hand rest on yours. Good. Relax. Very good. Now uncross your legs. Thank you. Relax. Good. Okay. Hold your arms up like this. Don't let me push you down. Don't let me push you up. Don't let me push you in. Don't let me push you out. Very good. I'm going to do the same thing. So try and push up. Push up. And down. Down. Push out. Pull in. Push up. And push down. Very good. Let's see. Okay. And then also, does this feel the same? Mm-hmm. Okay. Does that feel the same? Yeah.
Student (Kelsey): I'm also going to come back in the room with the doctor here in a little bit, and we're going to look in the back of your eye with one of the lights.
Patient (Ms. Jones): Okay.
Student (Kelsey): Let's see. All right. So this sounds just kind of like a general stress headache.
Student (Kelsey): Okay. So you may just have some tight muscles, which I can actually do something for if you would like me to.
Patient (Ms. Jones): Oh, that would be great.
Student (Kelsey): Okay. So this is called osteopathic manipulative medicine, and what I'm going to do is I'm just going to try and loosen up some of those muscles.
Student (Kelsey): Okay. So first I'm going to have you lay back down.
Patient (Ms. Jones): Okay.
Student (Kelsey): Cool. Yeah. And your muscles are a little tight. So I'm just doing some just gentle, just kind of soft tissue, kind of almost massage-like.
Student (Kelsey): Okay. So whenever you were giving me your history, you weren't really telling me anything that sounds like this might be more than just a general headache. I will go and present this to the physician, and we'll kind of talk about it. But from the sound of it, if the excedrin migraine helps you, then continue that.
Student (Kelsey): Okay. Also, some heat might be really helpful to kind of relax these muscles.
Patient (Ms. Jones): Oh, okay.
Student (Kelsey): Yeah, and I just want you to focus on letting your head just fall back into my hands.
Patient (Ms. Jones): Very good.
Student (Kelsey): Okay. Okay. Now I want you to try to turn your head back to normal. Straightforward. Good. Hold that for one, two, three, and relax. And again, one, two, three, and relax. And last time, one, two, three, and relax.
Patient (Ms. Jones): Yeah, I can tell a difference, too. It feels better.
Student (Kelsey): Good. Okay. All right. Well, I'm going to help you back up.
Student (Kelsey): Okay. And I'm going to go talk with the physician. Is it okay if I come back in with him?
Patient (Ms. Jones): Absolutely.
Student (Kelsey): All right. Very good. Any other questions or concerns before I leave?
Patient (Ms. Jones): I don't think so.
Student (Kelsey): No? All right. Well, it was very nice to meet you.
